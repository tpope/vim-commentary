In addition, you can yank a section of text before commenting it out:

gcy{motion}             Yank and then comment or uncomment the lines that
                        {motion} moves over.

gcy                     Yank and then comment or uncomment [count] lines.

{Visual}gcy             Yank and then comment or uncomment the highlighted
                        lines.

You can also duplicate a section of text before commenting it out:

gcd{motion}             Duplicate and then comment or uncomment the lines that
                        {motion} moves over.

gcd                     Duplicate and then comment or uncomment [count] lines.

{Visual}gcd             Duplicate and then comment or uncomment the highlighted
                        lines.

The |User| CommentaryPost autocommand fires after a successful operation and
can be used for advanced customization.
